# ProjectEuler.net - Solutions
## What is ProjectEuler?
Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.

The project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.

Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide.

It includes over 850 problems as of 12 August 2023, with a new one added approximately weekly.

Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.

## What is this repository for?
